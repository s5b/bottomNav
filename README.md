# bottomNav

Created: 3 Ocrtober 2021

## Description

Webpage navigation that is sticky to the bottom of the page - including on mobile.

This project can just be examined by opening the `index.html` file in
your browser.

The idea is for the navigation to always appear at the bottom of the _viewport_
with the main contant scrolling behind the navigation if it is longer than the 
_viewport_.
